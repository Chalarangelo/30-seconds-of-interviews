    "question": "What is CSS BEM?",
    "answer": "The BEM methodology is a naming convention for CSS classes in order to keep CSS more maintainable by defining namespaces to solve scoping issues. BEM stands for Block Element Modifier which is an explanation for its structure. A Block is a standalone component that is reusable across projects and acts as a \"namespace\" for sub components (Elements). Modifiers are used as flags when a Block or Element is in a certain state or is different in structure or style.\n\n```css\n/* block component */\n.block {\n}\n\n/* element */\n.block__element {\n}\n\n/* modifier */\n.block__element--modifier {\n}\n```\n\nHere is an example with the class names on markup:\n\n```html\n<nav class=\"navbar\">\n  <a href=\"/\" class=\"navbar__link navbar__link--active\"></a>\n  <a href=\"/\" class=\"navbar__link\"></a>\n  <a href=\"/\" class=\"navbar__link\"></a>\n</nav>\n```\n\nIn this case, `navbar` is the Block, `navbar__link` is an Element that makes no sense outside of the `navbar` component, and `navbar__link--active` is a Modifier that indicates a different state for the `navbar__link` Element.\n\nSince Modifiers are verbose, many opt to use `is-*` flags instead as modifiers.\n\n```html\n<a href=\"/\" class=\"navbar__link is-active\"></a>\n```\n\nThese must be chained to the Element and never alone however, or there will be scope issues.\n\n```css\n.navbar__link.is-active {\n}\n```",

This creates a shallow clone of the object.\n\n```js\nconst obj = { a: 1, b: 2 }\nconst shallowClone = { ...obj }\n```\n\nWith this technique, prototypes are ignored. In addition, nested objects are not cloned, but rather their references get copied, so nested objects still refer to the same objects as the original. Deep-cloning is much more complex in order to effectively clone any type of object (Date, RegExp, Function, Set, etc) that may be nested within the object.\n\nOther alternatives include:\n\n* `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` can be used to deep-clone a simple object, but it is CPU-intensive and only accepts valid JSON (therefore it strips functions and does not allow circular references).\n* `Object.assign({}, obj)` is another alternative.\n* `Object.keys(obj).reduce((acc, key) => (acc[key] = obj[key], acc), {})` is another more verbose alternative that shows the concept in greater depth.",

    "answer": "A focus ring is a visible outline given to focusable elements such as buttons and anchor tags. It varies depending on the vendor, but generally it appears as a blue outline around the element to indicate it is currently focused.\n\nIn the past, many people specified `outline: 0;` on the element to remove the focus ring. However, this causes accessibility issues for keyboard users because the focus state may not be clear. When not specified though, it causes an unappealing blue ring to appear around an element.\n\nIn recent times, frameworks like Bootstrap have opted to use a more appealing `box-shadow` outline to replace the default focus ring. However, this is still not ideal for mouse users.\n\nThe best solution is an upcoming pseudo-selector `:focus-visible` which can be polyfilled today with JavaScript. It will only show a focus ring if the user is using a keyboard and leave it hidden for mouse users. This keeps both aesthetics for mouse use and accessibility for keyboard use.",

The `new` operator must be used before invoking the constructor or the global object will be mutated.\n\n```js\nfunction Person(name, age) {\n  this.name = name\n  this.age = age\n}\nPerson.prototype.birthday = function() {\n  this.age++\n}\nconst person1 = new Person(\"John\", 50)\nconst person2 = new Person(\"Sally\", 20)\nperson1.birthday() // person1.age === 51\nperson2.birthday() // person2.age === 21\n```\n\n##### Factory function\n\nCreates a new object similar to a constructor, but can store private data using a closure. There is also no need to use `new` before invoking the function or the `this` keyword. Factory functions usually discard the idea of prototypes and keep all properties and methods as own properties of the object.\n\n```js\nconst createPerson = (name, age) => {\n  const birthday = () => person.age++\n  const person = { name, age, birthday }\n  return person\n}\nconst person = createPerson(\"John\", 50)\nperson.birthday() // person.age === 51\n```\n\n##### `Object.create()`\n\nSets the prototype of the newly created object.\n\n```js\nconst personProto = {\n  birthday() {\n    this.age++\n  }\n}\nconst person = Object.create(personProto)\nperson.age = 50\nperson.birthday() // person.age === 51\n```\n\nA second argument can also be supplied to `Object.create()` which acts as a descriptor for the new properties to be defined.\n\n```js\nObject.create(personProto, {\n  age: {\n    value: 50,\n    writable: true,\n    enumerable: true\n  }\n})\n```",

    "question": "What are Promises?",
    "answer": "The `Promise` object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.\nAn example can be the following snippet, which after 100ms prints out the result string to the standard output. Also, note the catch, which can be used for error handling. `Promise`s are chainable.\n\n```js\nnew Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    resolve('result')\n  }, 100)\n})\n  .then(console.log)\n  .catch(console.error)\n```",

Additionally, they provide the ability to create components that can be reused when they have similar functionality with minor differences, avoiding duplication which would require multiple changes whenever the structure of a component which is reused in multiple places needs to be updated.\n\nWhen working with DOM manipulation libraries like jQuery, the data of an application is generally kept in the DOM itself, often as class names or `data` attributes. Manipulating the DOM to update the UI involves many extra steps and can introduce subtle bugs over time. Keeping the state separate and letting a framework handle the UI updates when the state changes reduces cognitive load, i.e. saying you want the UI to look a certain way when the state is a certain value is the declarative way of creating an application, instead of manually updating the UI to reflect the new state (imperative).",

    "question": "What are the differences between `var`, `let`, `const` and no keyword statements?",
    "answer": "##### No keyword prefix\n\nWhen no keyword is prefixed before a variable declaration, it is either assigning a global variable if one does not exist, or reassigns an already declared variable. In non-strict mode, it will assign the variable as a property of the global object `this` (`window` in browsers). In strict mode, it will throw an error to prevent unwanted global variables from being created.\n\n##### var\n\n`var` was the default statement to declare a variable until ES2015. It creates a function-scoped variable that can be reassigned and redeclared. However, due to its lack of block scoping, it can cause issues if the variable is being reused in a loop that contains an asynchronous callback because the variable will continue to exist outside of the block scope.\n\nBelow, by the time the the `setTimeout` callback executes, the loop has already finished and the `i` variable is `10`, so all ten callbacks reference the same variable available in the function scope.\n\n```js\nfor (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    console.log(i) // logs `10` ten times\n  })\n}\n\n/* ==================== Solutions with `var` ==================== */\nfor (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  // Passed as an argument will use the value as-is in that point in time\n  setTimeout(console.log, 0, i)\n}\n\nfor (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  // Create a new function scope that will use the value as-is in that point in time\n  ;(i => {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      console.log(i)\n    })\n  })(i)\n}\n```\n\n##### let\n\n`let` was introduced in ES2015 and is the new preferred way to declare variables that will be reassigned later. Trying to redeclare a variable again will throw an error. It is block-scoped so that using it in a loop will keep it scoped to the iteration.\n\n```js\nfor (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    console.log(i) // logs 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\n  })\n}\n```\n\n##### const\n\n`const` was introduced in ES2015 and is the new preferred default way to declare all variables if they won't be reassigned later, even for objects that will be mutated (as long as the reference to the object does not change).
