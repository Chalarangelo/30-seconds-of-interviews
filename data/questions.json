    "answer": "The BEM methodology is another naming convention for CSS classes. The BEM stands for Block, Element, Modifier which is an explanation for its structure. Block is a standalone component that is reusable across projects. Elements and modifiers are part of the block with no standalone meaning. Here is the example of the typical syntax:\n\n```css\n/* block component */\n.block {}\n\n/* element */\n.block__element {}\n\n/* modifier */\n.block__element-modifier {}\n```",

    "question": "How do you clone an object in JavaScript?",
    "answer": "Using the object spread operator `...`, the object's own enumerable properties can be copied\ninto the new object. This creates a shallow clone of the object.\n\n```js\nconst obj = { a: 1, b: 2 };\nconst shallowClone = { ...obj };\n```\n\nWith this technique, prototypes are ignored. In addition, nested objects are not cloned, but rather their references get copied, so nested objects still refer to the same objects as the original. Deep-cloning is much more complex in order to effectively clone any type of object (Dates, RegExp, Function, Set, etc) that may be nested within the object.",

    "answer": "Including `'use strict'` at the beginning of your JavaScript source file enables strict mode, which enfores more strict parsing and error handling of JavaScript code. It is considered a good practice and offers a lot of benefits, such as:\n\n* Easier debugging due to eliminating silent errors.\n* Disallows variable redefinition.\n* Prevents accidental global variables.\n* Oftentimes provides increased performance over identical code that is not running in strict mode.\n* Simplifies `eval()` and `arguments`.\n* Helps make JavaScript more secure.",
