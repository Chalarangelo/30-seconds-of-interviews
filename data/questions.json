    "question": "What is CSS BEM?",
    "answer": "The BEM methodology is a naming convention for CSS classes in order to keep CSS more maintainable by defining namespaces to solve scoping issues. BEM stands for Block Element Modifier which is an explanation for its structure. A Block is a standalone component that is reusable across projects and acts as a \"namespace\" for sub components (Elements). Modifiers are used as flags when a Block or Element is in a certain state or is different in structure or style.\n\n```css\n/* block component */\n.block {\n}\n\n/* element */\n.block__element {\n}\n\n/* modifier */\n.block__element--modifier {\n}\n```\n\nHere is an example with the class names on markup:\n\n```html\n<nav class=\"navbar\">\n  <a href=\"/\" class=\"navbar__link navbar__link--active\"></a>\n  <a href=\"/\" class=\"navbar__link\"></a>\n  <a href=\"/\" class=\"navbar__link\"></a>\n</nav>\n```\n\nIn this case, `navbar` is the Block, `navbar__link` is an Element that makes no sense outside of the `navbar` component, and `navbar__link--active` is a Modifier that indicates a different state for the `navbar__link` Element.\n\nSince Modifiers are verbose, many opt to use `is-*` flags instead as modifiers.\n\n```html\n<a href=\"/\" class=\"navbar__link is-active\"></a>\n```\n\nThese must be chained to the Element and never alone however, or there will be scope issues.\n\n```css\n.navbar__link.is-active {\n}\n```",

    "question": "What is Big O Notation?",
    "answer": "Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe time complexity of an algorithm. The best algorithms will execute the fastest and have the simplest complexity.\n\nAlgorithms don't always perform the same and vary based on the data they are supplied. While in some cases they will execute quickly, in other cases they will execute slowly, even with the same number of elements to deal with.\n\nIn these examples, the base time is `1ms` to make it more familiar.\n\n##### O(1)\n\n```js\narr[arr.length - 1]\n```\n\nConstant time complexity. No matter how many elements the array has, it will theoretically take (excluding real-world variation) the same amount of time to execute.\n\n- 1000 elements = `1ms`\n\n##### O(N)\n\n```js\narr.filter(fn)\n```\n\nLinear time complexity. The execution time will increase linearly with the number of elements the array has. If the array has 1000 elements and the function takes 1ms to execute, 7000 elements will take 7ms to execute. This is because the function must iterate through all elements of the array before returning a result.\n\n- 1000 elements = `1000ms`\n\n##### O(1-N)\n\n```js\narr.some(fn)\n```\n\n- 1000 elements = `1ms <= x <= 1000 ms`\n\nThe execution time varies depending on the data supplied to the function, it may return very early or very late. The best case here is O(1) and the worst case is O(N).\n\n##### O(logN)\n\n```js\narr.sort(fn)\n```\n\nBrowsers usually implement the quicksort algorithm for the `sort()` method which is logN time complexity. This is very efficient for large collections.\n\n- 1000 elements = `3ms`\n\n##### O(N^2)\n\n```js\nfor (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {\n  for (let j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe execution time rises quadratically with the number of elements. Usually the result of nesting loops.\n\n- 1000 elements = `1000000ms`\n\n##### O(N!)\n\n```js\nconst permutations = arr => {\n  if (arr.length <= 2) return arr.length === 2 ? [arr, [arr[1], arr[0]]] : arr\n  return arr.reduce(\n    (acc, item, i) =>\n      acc.concat(\n        permutations([...arr.slice(0, i), ...arr.slice(i + 1)]).map(val => [\n          item,\n          ...val\n        ])\n      ),\n    []\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe execution time rises extremely fast with even just 1 addition to the array.\n\n1000 elements = `Infinity` (practically) ms",

    "answer": "Browsers have a cache to temporarily store files on websites so they don't need to be re-downloaded again when switching between pages or reloading the same page. The server is set up to send headers that tell the browser to store the file for a given amount of time. This greatly increases website speed and preserves bandwidth.\n\nHowever, it can cause problems when the website has been changed by developers because the user's cache still references old files. This can either leave them with old functionality or break a website if the cached CSS and JavaScript files are referencing elements that no longer exist, have moved or have been renamed.\n\nCache busting is the process of forcing the browser to download the new files. This is done by naming the file something different to the old file.\n\nA common technique to force the browser to re-download the file is to append a query string to the end of the file.\n\n- `src=\"js/script.js\"` => `src=\"js/script.js?v=2\"`\n\nThe browser considers it a different file but prevents the need to change the file name.",

    "answer": "Refactoring the functions to return promises and using `async/await` is usually the best option. Instead of supplying the functions with callbacks that cause deep nesting, they return a promise that can be `await`ed and will be resolved once the data has arrived, allowing the next line of code to be evaluated in a sync-like fashion.\n\nThe above code can be restructured like so:\n\n```js\nasync function asyncAwaitVersion() {\n  const a = await getData()\n  const b = await getMoreData(a)\n  const c = await getMoreData(b)\n  const d = await getMoreData(c)\n  const e = await getMoreData(e)\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nThere are lots of ways to solve the issue of callback hells:\n\n* Modularization: break callbacks into independent functions\n* Use a control flow library, like async\n* Use generators with Promises\n* Use async/await (from v7 on)",

    "question": "How do you clone an object in JavaScript?",

This creates a shallow clone of the object.\n\n```js\nconst obj = { a: 1, b: 2 }\nconst shallowClone = { ...obj }\n```\n\nWith this technique, prototypes are ignored. In addition, nested objects are not cloned, but rather their references get copied, so nested objects still refer to the same objects as the original. Deep-cloning is much more complex in order to effectively clone any type of object (Date, RegExp, Function, Set, etc) that may be nested within the object.\n\nOther alternatives include:\n\n* `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` can be used to deep-clone a simple object, but it is CPU-intensive and only accepts valid JSON (therefore it strips functions and does not allow circular references).\n* `Object.assign({}, obj)` is another alternative.\n* `Object.keys(obj).reduce((acc, key) => (acc[key] = obj[key], acc), {})` is another more verbose alternative that shows the concept in greater depth.",

The closure has access to variables in three scopes:\n\n* Variables declared in its own scope\n* Variables declared in the scope of the parent function\n* Variables declared in the global scope\n\nIn JavaScript, all functions are closures because they have access to the outer scope, but most functions don't utilise the usefulness of closures: the persistence of state. Closures are also sometimes called stateful functions because of this.\n\nIn addition, closures are the only way to store private data that can't be accessed from the outside in JavaScript.

This allows the parent element to handle behavior as though the target element was listening to the event, rather than all children of the parent or the parent itself.\n\nThis provides two main benefits:\n\n- It increases performance and reduces memory consumption by only needing to register a single event listener to handle potentially thousands of elements.\n- If elements are dynamically added to the parent, there is no need to register new event listeners for them.\n\nInstead of:\n\n```js\ndocument.querySelectorAll(\"span\").forEach(span => {\n  span.addEventListener(\"click\", handleSpanClick)\n})\n```\n\nEvent delegation involves using a condition to ensure the child target matches our desired element:\n\n```js\ndocument.addEventListener(\"click\", e => {\n  if (e.target.matches(\"span\")) {\n    handleSpanClick()\n  }\n})\n```",

    "answer": "Event-driven programming is a paradigm that involves building applications that send and receive events. When the program emits events, the program responds by running any callback functions that are registered to that event and context, passing in associated data to the function. With this pattern, events can be emitted into the wild without throwing errors even if no functions are subscribed to it.\n\nA common example of this is the pattern of elements listening to DOM events such as `click` and `mouseenter`, where a callback function is run when the event occurs.\n\n```js\ndocument.addEventListener(\"click\", function(event) {\n  // This callback function is run when the user\n  // clicks on the document.\n})\n```\n\nWithout the context of the DOM, the pattern may look like this:\n\n```js\nconst hub = createEventHub()\nhub.on(\"message\", function(data) {\n  console.log(`${data.username} said ${data.text}`)\n})\nhub.emit(\"message\", {\n  username: \"John\",\n  text: \"Hello?\"\n})\n```\n\nWith this implementation, `on` is the way to _subscribe_ to an event, while `emit` is the way to _publish_ the event.",

    "answer": "A focus ring is a visible outline given to focusable elements such as buttons and anchor tags. It varies depending on the vendor, but generally it appears as a blue outline around the element to indicate it is currently focused.\n\nIn the past, many people specified `outline: 0;` on the element to remove the focus ring. However, this causes accessibility issues for keyboard users because the focus state may not be clear. When not specified though, it causes an unappealing blue ring to appear around an element.\n\nIn recent times, frameworks like Bootstrap have opted to use a more appealing `box-shadow` outline to replace the default focus ring. However, this is still not ideal for mouse users.\n\nThe best solution is an upcoming pseudo-selector `:focus-visible` which can be polyfilled today with JavaScript. It will only show a focus ring if the user is using a keyboard and leave it hidden for mouse users. This keeps both aesthetics for mouse use and accessibility for keyboard use.",

    "answer": "Memoization is the process of caching the output of function calls so that subsequent calls are faster. Calling the function again with the same input will return the cached output without needing to do the calculation again.\n\nA basic implementation in JavaScript looks like this:\n\n```js\nconst memoize = fn => {\n  const cache = new Map()\n  return value => {\n    const cachedResult = cache.get(value)\n    if (cachedResult !== undefined) return cachedResult\n    const result = fn(value)\n    cache.set(value, result)\n    return result\n  }\n}\n```",

The `new` operator must be used before invoking the constructor or the global object will be mutated.\n\n```js\nfunction Person(name, age) {\n  this.name = name\n  this.age = age\n}\nPerson.prototype.birthday = function() {\n  this.age++\n}\nconst person1 = new Person(\"John\", 50)\nconst person2 = new Person(\"Sally\", 20)\nperson1.birthday() // person1.age === 51\nperson2.birthday() // person2.age === 21\n```\n\n##### Factory function\n\nCreates a new object similar to a constructor, but can store private data using a closure. There is also no need to use `new` before invoking the function or the `this` keyword. Factory functions usually discard the idea of prototypes and keep all properties and methods as own properties of the object.\n\n```js\nconst createPerson = (name, age) => {\n  const birthday = () => person.age++\n  const person = { name, age, birthday }\n  return person\n}\nconst person = createPerson(\"John\", 50)\nperson.birthday() // person.age === 51\n```\n\n##### `Object.create()`\n\nSets the prototype of the newly created object.\n\n```js\nconst personProto = {\n  birthday() {\n    this.age++\n  }\n}\nconst person = Object.create(personProto)\nperson.age = 50\nperson.birthday() // person.age === 51\n```\n\nA second argument can also be supplied to `Object.create()` which acts as a descriptor for the new properties to be defined.\n\n```js\nObject.create(personProto, {\n  age: {\n    value: 50,\n    writable: true,\n    enumerable: true\n  }\n})\n```",

    "answer": "Recursion is the repeated application of a process. In JavaScript, recursion involves functions that call themselves repeatedly until they reach a base condition. The base condition breaks the out of the recursion loop because otherwise the function would call itself indefinitely. Recursion is very useful when working with data structures that contain nesting where the number of levels deep is unknown.\n\nFor example, you may have a thread of comments returned from a database that exist in a flat array but need to be nested for display in the UI. Each comment is either a top-level comment (no parent) or is a reply to a parent comment. Comments can be a reply of a reply of a reply... we have no knowledge beforehand the number of levels deep a comment may be. This is where recursion can help.\n\n```js\nconst nest = (items, id = null, link = \"parent_id\") =>\n  items\n    .filter(item => item[link] === id)\n    .map(item => ({ ...item, children: nest(items, item.id) }))\n\nconst comments = [\n  { id: 1, parent_id: null, text: \"First reply to post.\" },\n  { id: 2, parent_id: 1, text: \"First reply to comment #1.\" },\n  { id: 3, parent_id: 1, text: \"Second reply to comment #1.\" },\n  { id: 4, parent_id: 3, text: \"First reply to comment #3.\" },\n  { id: 5, parent_id: 4, text: \"First reply to comment #4.\" },\n  { id: 6, aprent_id: null, text: \"Second reply to post.\" }\n]\n\nnest(comments)\n/*\n[\n  { id: 1, parent_id: null, text: \"First reply to post.\", children: [...] },\n  { id: 6, parent_id: null, text: \"Second reply to post.\" children: [] }\n]\n*/\n```\n\nIn the above example, the base condition is met if `filter()` returns an empty array. The chained `map()` will never be called which contains the callback to invoke the function recursively, thereby breaking the loop.",

    "answer": "REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is a software design pattern for network architecture. A RESTful web application exposes data in the form of information about its resources.\n\nGenerally, this concept is used in web applications to manage state. With most applications, there is a common theme of reading, creating, updating, and destroying data. Data is modularized into separate tables like `posts`, `users`, `comments`, and a RESTful API exposes access to this data with:\n\n- An identifier for the resource. This is known as the endpoint or URL for the resource.\n- The operation the server should perform on that resource in the form of an HTTP method or verb. The common HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.\n\nHere is an example of the URL and HTTP method with a `posts` resource:\n\n- Reading: `/posts/` => GET\n- Creating: `/posts/new` => POST\n- Updating: `/posts/:id` => PUT\n- Destroying: `/posts/:id` => DELETE",

    "answer": "CSS sprites combine multiple images into one image, limiting the number of HTTP requests a browser has to make, thus improving load times. Even under the new HTTP/2 protocol, this remains true.\n\nUnder HTTP/1.1, at most one request is allowed per TCP connection. With HTTP/1.1, modern browsers open multiple parallel connections (between 2 to 8) but it is limited. With HTTP/2, all requests between the browser and the server are multiplexed on a single TCP connection. This means the cost of opening and closing multiple connections is mitigated, resulting in a better usage of the TCP connection and limits the impact of latency between the client and server. It could then become possible to load tens of images in parallel on the same TCP connection.\n\nHowever, according to [benchmark results](https://blog.octo.com/en/http2-arrives-but-sprite-sets-aint-no-dead/), although HTTP/2 offers 50% improvement over HTTP/1.1, in most cases the sprite set is still faster to load than individual images.\n\nTo utilize a spritesheet in CSS, one would use certain properties, such as `background-image`, `background-position` and `background-size` to ultimately alter the `background` of an element.",

Regular functions can have their `this` value changed with the methods `call()`, `apply()` and `bind()`.

Additionally, they provide the ability to create components that can be reused when they have similar functionality with minor differences, avoiding duplication which would require multiple changes whenever the structure of a component which is reused in multiple places needs to be updated.\n\nWhen working with DOM manipulation libraries like jQuery, the data of an application is generally kept in the DOM itself, often as class names or `data` attributes. Manipulating the DOM to update the UI involves many extra steps and can introduce subtle bugs over time. Keeping the state separate and letting a framework handle the UI updates when the state changes reduces cognitive load. Saying you want the UI to look a certain way when the state is a certain value is the declarative way of creating an application, instead of the imperative way of manually updating the UI to reflect the new state.",

    "answer": "##### No keyword\n\nWhen no keyword exists before a variable assignment, it is either assigning a global variable if one does not exist, or reassigns an already declared variable. In non-strict mode, if the variable has not yet been declared, it will assign the variable as a property of the global object (`window` in browsers). In strict mode, it will throw an error to prevent unwanted global variables from being created.\n\n##### var\n\n`var` was the default statement to declare a variable until ES2015. It creates a function-scoped variable that can be reassigned and redeclared. However, due to its lack of block scoping, it can cause issues if the variable is being reused in a loop that contains an asynchronous callback because the variable will continue to exist outside of the block scope.\n\nBelow, by the time the the `setTimeout` callback executes, the loop has already finished and the `i` variable is `10`, so all ten callbacks reference the same variable available in the function scope.\n\n```js\nfor (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    // logs `10` ten times\n    console.log(i)\n  })\n}\n\n/* Solutions with `var` */\nfor (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  // Passed as an argument will use the value as-is in\n  // that point in time\n  setTimeout(console.log, 0, i)\n}\n\nfor (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  // Create a new function scope that will use the value\n  // as-is in that point in time\n  ;(i => {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      console.log(i)\n    })\n  })(i)\n}\n```\n\n##### let\n\n`let` was introduced in ES2015 and is the new preferred way to declare variables that will be reassigned later. Trying to redeclare a variable again will throw an error. It is block-scoped so that using it in a loop will keep it scoped to the iteration.\n\n```js\nfor (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    // logs 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\n    console.log(i)\n  })\n}\n```\n\n##### const\n\n`const` was introduced in ES2015 and is the new preferred default way to declare all variables if they won't be reassigned later, even for objects that will be mutated (as long as the reference to the object does not change). It is block-scoped and cannot be reassigned.\n\n```js\nconst myObject = {}\nmyObject.prop = \"hello!\" // No error\nmyObject = \"hello\" // Error\n```",

    "question": "What is a cross-site scripting attack (XSS) and how do you prevent it?",
    "answer": "XSS refers to client-side code injection where the attacker injects malicious scripts into a legitimate website or web application. This is often achieved when the application does not validate user input and freely injects dynamic HTML content.\n\nFor example, a comment system will be at risk if it does not validate or escape user input. If the comment contains unescaped HTML, the comment can inject a `<script>` tag into the website that other users will execute against their knowledge.\n\n- The malicious script has access to cookies which are often used to store session tokens. If an attacker can obtain a user’s session cookie, they can impersonate the user.\n- The script can arbitrarily manipulate the DOM of the page the script is executing in, allowing the attacker to insert pieces of content that appear to be a real part of the website.\n- The script can use AJAX to send HTTP requests with arbitrary content to arbitrary destinations.",
    "goodToHear": [
      "On the client, using `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` prevents the browser from running the string through the HTML parser which would execute scripts in it.",
      "On the server, escaping HTML tags will prevent the browser from parsing the user input as actual HTML and therefore won't execute the script."
