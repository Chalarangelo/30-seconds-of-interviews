### What does `0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3` evaluate to?

#### Answer

It evaluates to `false` because JavaScript uses the IEEE 754 standard for Math and it makes use of 64-bit floating numbers. This causes precision errors when doing decimal calculations, in short, due to computers working in Base 2 while decimal is Base 10.

```js
0.1 + 0.2 // 0.300000004
```
