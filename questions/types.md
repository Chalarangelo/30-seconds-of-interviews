### What are JavaScript data types?

#### Answer

The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types, six of them being primitive: `Boolean`, `Null`, `Undefined`, `Number`, `String`, `Symbol` and one non-primitive data type: `Object`.

#### Good to hear

* Mention of newly added `Symbol` data type
* `Array`, `Date` and `function` are all of type `object`
* Functions in JavaScript are objects with the capability of being callable
